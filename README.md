## Opening
Hi everybody! I'm AsterNullbyte, woof! If you are not coming to this page from either my cardd, my twitter, or one of my other socials, allow me to introduce myself! 

I'm a Femboy Puppyboy Virus VTuber, with a background in cybersecurity! I have worked in a professional setting doing multiple roles including as a security researcher at one point, and I do my best to try and educate everybody on digital security and keeping themselves safe in the big 26! You can find me cross-streaming on twitch and youtube, and find me posting whatever's on my mind on my (18+) twitter!

In this megathread, I'll be going over all different types of scams, how to identify scams on your own, and what the most common scams are on each platform (by my own research or experience!). If you have any questions, or want to add on suggestions then please raise an issue or make a pull request! Thank you for helping to keep the internet safe for everybody :D

## Discord
  ### DM scams - Best pratices
  99% of scams take place via DM's (Direct Messages) due to the fact they're 1-on-1 communication, and server moderators can't take preventitive action. Here are the BEST pratices to catch it very quickly.

  1. You should TURN ON message filtering. <img width="1383" height="870" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c84237d6-76e6-44a7-884b-1521c3c77cd4" />
  Go to "Content & Social" (1) and then "Direct Message spam" (2), setting it to "Filter from non-friends". You can set it to everybody if you wish, but this is working off of the assumption that you only add people on discord you trust.

  2. You should scroll down to "Social Permissions" and ENABLE "Message requests".

     > NOTE: Discord generally does a good job filtering scammers/spammers/etc with this feature, but it is not 100% accurate and depends on multiple factors that are not public knowledge. Do not rely on message filters as the "end all".

      If you turn off direct messages from people you share a server with, this feature will be disabled. There is no inbetween.
  
  3. Limit your friend requests

  I have my friend requests on my personal account set to everybody because I can filter out who I want to talk to and who's going to waste my time, but if you're on discord only for a small and specific friendgroup then I suggest setting this to friends of friends only. This will generally work very well, with the only caveat being that you would have to manually add everybody you wanted to talk to if they weren't a friend of somebody you already have on your friends list.

  ### DM Scams - Identifying

  Obviously, this list will not contain every scam run by people until the end of time, it will be your responsibility to use common sense to determine for yourself if the person you are talking to is a scammer, I am just providing you the resources to make an educated decision.

#### Initial Contact
Most scam attempts work off of some sort of pregenerated script, The person(s) who made the actual script is smart enough to realise that 90% of the time their scam won't work and they'll be wasting their time so they sell it to any idiot on a black market site and money to spare to perpetuate their scams. Most of the time, these are either children or people from 3rd world countries trying to flip expensive accounts as it pays more than getting an actual job. 

This helps us though! *Most* scammers will speak very poor english outside of their script, or their responses will seem robotic (e.g. You ask them a question and they continue yapping about whatever they're trying to get you to do). What you're looking for on initial contact are getting filtered message requests from people who've never talked in that specific server, or to you directly before, and if you give them even a tiny bit of attention they'll quickly start throwing up red flags.

Here's an example of that in action.

<img width="451" height="563" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/87bec196-ab34-43df-8f0f-e26bdd8959e0" />

> NOTE: (Disregard "No servers in common" as they were banned before I took this screenshot. They were in a server I really only lurk in for self-hosting related issues/questions.)

This user is a clearly compromised account, as they had discord nitro, do not trust just because somebody has nitro that they are legitmate. They also had no activity in the server, and randomly sent me a dm out of all people. They were not a moderator nor had a reason to reach out to me, which 9/10 is what scammers do by targeting people with discord nitro (like I do, sue me I like using cute emojis) or accounts that seem valuable. 

When I give 'her' attention, you can see that this person replies in broken english (I know some european/RU users also speak like this, but given our above assessment this only raises their suspicion level.) and while I won't give the full conversation (my twitter post mocking them can be found [here](https://x.com/AsterNullbyte/status/2021204183995544062)) they claimed to be a starving artist looking for feedback on "their" art, which was likely created by Charles G. ParagraphTyper the 5th. (I'll give you a cookie if you figure out what service I'm talking about lol) and while I do generally like messing with scammers, I was pressed for time so I simply had them banned from the offending server and went about my day. 

What likely was going to happen was they were going to try and get me to click on a website which would have either scraped my IP, my discord cookie, or gave me a link to a fake discord which I would have had to sign in 'again'.

**BLOCK AND REPORT THESE PEOPLE. DO NOT FOLLOW THEIR INSTRUCTIONS. REPORT THEM TO MUTUAL SERVERS.**
***DO NOT OPEN ANY LINKS OR FILES THEY MAY GIVE YOU.***
> You can report them easily by using the 'Report Spam' button in the top menu. If they get enough reports, discord will manually review them before banning them! (I have seen it done myself)

### Scammer behavior
Scammers rely on using your human emotions to take over and make stupid decisions. You have a monkey brain, we all do. It's hard wired to be naturally empathetic to other people, and as such people take advantage of that.
Your best tool to avoiding falling victim is remembering the following, and is a good rule of thumb for any interaction:
1. Do you know this person? If you're randomly getting approached by somebody you've never talked to before, and you have no reason to be talking to them (e.g. you're doing commissions) then remain cautious to what they want from you.
2. Are they trying to sell you something? In conjecture with 1, if you weren't intent on buying something from them and they try and offer it out of the blue then you should take a step back and reassess the situation.
3. Are they trying to pressure you? Most scammers will attempt to convince you to ACT NOW, THINK LATER. This is exactly what they want you to do, because if you take a step back and take a minute or two to analyze the situation then you would likely not carry through with their requests, so they try and get you in the mindset you have to act immediately or else.
4. Are they trying to get you to click on a link or open a file? Do not put human trust into this factor, is the link they are sending you known? Is it appropraite for what they want? (e.g. sending you a link to "ro.blox" instead of "roblox.com") If they are sending you a file that you did not explicitly ask for (Like buying commissioned assets) do **NOT** download it and report it.

I have seen the following used as scams in my time:
>Starving artist looking for work

>"Vote for my server" on random website

>"My team is short a player"

>Crypto (Generally only based in crypto related servers)

>Free nitro offers

>Free robux

>Free roblox exploits (I swear to you, I'm not making that shit up)

>"I reported your discord/steam account on accident"

>Fake discord/steam support
