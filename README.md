## Opening
Hi everybody! I'm AsterNullbyte, woof! If you are not coming to this page from either my cardd, my twitter, or one of my other socials, allow me to introduce myself! 

I'm a Puppyboy Virus VTuber, with a background in cybersecurity! I have worked in a professional setting doing multiple roles including as a security researcher at one point, and I do my best to try and educate everybody on digital security and keeping themselves safe in the big 26! You can find me cross-streaming on twitch and youtube, and find me posting whatever's on my mind on my (18+) twitter!

In this megathread, I'll be going over all different types of scams, how to identify scams on your own, and what the most common scams are on each platform (by my own research or experience!). If you have any questions, or want to add on suggestions then please raise an issue or make a pull request! Thank you for helping to keep the internet safe for everybody :D

Below is the table of contents for you to locate a specific platform!
